##  About Me

I'm a **backend-focused Java developer** with expertise in **Spring Boot**, **RESTful APIs**, **Git**, and relational databases like **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**. 
I build clean, scalable systems with a passion for solving real-world problems and continuously improving.
Open to new challenges—and occasionally, I dabble in **video editing** to combine creativity with tech. Right now, I’m looking to contribute to impactful software projects with great teams.
